# Yas @ NDCSydney

## Bio

Also known as Yashints, a front-end lead engineer, international speaker, blogger, and hiker.

Although it doesn‚Äôt look like it, Yas is an almond croissant addict cleverly disguised as a successful web developer. Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living while sitting in a caf√© eating a croissant and drinking a cappuccino, he‚Äôs focused his energy on the web, which happily has proven itself to be a wonderful decision.

He is a fan of web technologies, having more than a decade of experience developing small to large scale applications. Interested to find out more? Follow him on üëáüèº
